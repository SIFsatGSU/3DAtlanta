This project recreates an Atlanta city block – specifically Decatur Street at Central Avenue (where Classroom South is now) – to show the historical view of the space as it looked in the 1920’s – 1930’s. The goal is to showcase an interactive space where students can experience it as though they were ‘walking through’ it in the past. As a means to connect this project beyond GSU, this project is collaborating with students and faculty at Emory who are also working on a similar historical project.

### Current WorkFlow

**CityEngine> Blender> Unity**

The workflow branches like this:
 - CityEngine team pushes in-progress projects to Unity Engine team
 - Blender Experts in both Unity and CityEngine team combine together to build buildings in area locale.
 - Unity team receives and builds scripts and environment to game demo and relevant character/story for that building is added if applicable.  
 - Outside of this technical process, the Research Team focuses on the historical objectives for the area locale, and tries to bring anything from the [Special Collections](http://library.gsu.edu/search-collections/special-collections-archives/).
