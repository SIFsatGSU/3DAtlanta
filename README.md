# 3D Atlanta

This project recreates an Atlanta city block – specifically Decatur Street at Central Avenue (where Classroom South is now) – to show the historical view of the space as it looked in the 1920’s – 1930’s. The goal is to showcase an interactive space where students can experience it as though they were ‘walking through’ it in the past. As a means to connect this project beyond GSU, this project is collaborating with students and faculty at Emory who are also working on a similar historical project.

### Current WorkFlow

**Database>Packages>Unity and CityEngine**

Currently a lot of effort is being put into the database of 3d buildings for the packages of the project. These packages will help facilitate the outsourcing of buildings' history, models, and any other relevant information to students and teachers.

The Unity side will be mainly experimenting with the scale, placement, and interaction of the buildings. The CityEngine side will focus on using the data from the ArcGIS suite in creating a city in CityEngine.
